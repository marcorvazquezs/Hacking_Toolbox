# Pentest Checklist

This serves as a simplified checklist.

## Enumeration

- Run nmap scans with service/version detection
  - From scan results, perform further enumeration scans of identified services
  - If there are any web servers, start running `dirsearch` with larger wordlists

- Check version numbers of services against the Exploit Database and Google
- Start with less complex services and perform manual enumeration.
- Leave web servers last.

## Web Apps

- Ensure that `dirsearch` has been run with a huge wordlist, and various file extensions.

- Manually browse the app while proxying via Burp.

- Use Burp Spider to crawl the site as you browse.

- Check for LFI if pages are being loaded dynamically.

- If possible, can we get shell? I.e. apache log pollution, or using php filters to inject content.

- If there's some kind of login form prohibiting entry, try SQL injection, brute-force, etc.
